    <h1>🔐 Tumeguard Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 13, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
    <p>Tumeguard processes limited Discord-related data solely for moderation functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 Message content – analyzed for toxicity, spam, and harmful content</li>
      <li>🆔 User IDs, usernames, and roles – used for enforcement and audit logs</li>
      <li>📁 Server and channel IDs – required for configuration and behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why We Collect It</h2>
    <p>This data is temporarily processed to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🚫 Detect spam, toxic language, and malicious links</li>
      <li>🛡️ Enforce server moderation rules automatically</li>
      <li>🧾 Generate temporary audit logs of actions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Tumeguard integrates with trusted moderation APIs to enhance detection capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://perspectiveapi.com" target="_blank">Google Perspective API</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing" target="_blank">Google Safe Browsing</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/web-risk" target="_blank">Google Web Risk</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only relevant message content is sent for analysis. No personal identifiers (user IDs, usernames, etc.) are shared externally.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🗑️ <strong>No long-term data storage:</strong> Tumeguard does not permanently store messages or personal information.</li>
      <li>🧠 <strong>Temporary memory use:</strong> In-memory data may be briefly cached for things like rate limiting or spam detection, and is regularly purged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights & Usage Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🔒 Tumeguard operates only in servers where it has been manually invited by an admin or moderator.</li>
      <li>✅ If you are a server owner, you can remove Tumeguard at any time to stop all functionality.</li>

    </ul>
